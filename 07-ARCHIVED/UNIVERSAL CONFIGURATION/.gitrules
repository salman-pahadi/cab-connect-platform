## COMMIT BEST PRACTICES

### Do
- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change per commit)
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Include breaking change notices in commit body
- Sign commits with GPG when possible

### Don't
- Commit directly to main branch
- Use vague messages like "fix bug" or "update code"
- Include unrelated changes in single commit
- Commit commented-out code
- Commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Force push to shared branches

## REPOSITORY WORKFLOW

### Development Flow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes with proper testing
3. Ensure all checks pass (lint, tests, security)
4. Create pull request to `develop`
5. Code review and approval required
6. Merge to `develop` with squash or rebase
7. Deploy to staging for testing
8. Merge `develop` to `main` for production

### Code Review Requirements
- Minimum 1 approval required
- All CI checks must pass
- No merge conflicts
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Performance review for optimization changes

## ISSUE MANAGEMENT

### Labels
- **Priority:** P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Medium), P3 (Low)
- **Type:** bug, enhancement, feature, documentation
- **Phase:** phase-0, phase-1, phase-2, phase-3, phase-4, phase-5
- **Component:** frontend, backend, mobile, docker, database
- **Status:** in-progress, review-needed, blocked, testing

### Issue Title Format
`[Component] Brief description of issue`

Examples:
- `[Frontend] Responsive navigation menu not working on mobile`
- `[Backend] PostgreSQL connection pooling optimization needed`
- `[Docker] Redis container fails to start on Windows`

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### Sensitive Data
- Never commit API keys, passwords, or secrets
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Review commits for accidental inclusion of sensitive data
- Rotate any accidentally committed secrets immediately

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` for vulnerability scanning
- Document any security-related dependency updates

## VERSION MANAGEMENT

### Semantic Versioning
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **MAJOR:** Breaking changes
- **MINOR:** New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH:** Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Tagging
- Tag releases: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"`
- Use annotated tags for releases
- Include release notes in tag messages
