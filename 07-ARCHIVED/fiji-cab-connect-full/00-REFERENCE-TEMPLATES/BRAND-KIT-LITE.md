# 🎨 BRAND KIT (PRACTICAL VERSION)
## Work with What Clients Actually Give You

**Reality Check:** 90% of clients provide only:
- Domain name
- Founded year
- Target audience (vague)
- Industry
- Project type (static/dynamic/mobile)

**That's 5 fields. Not 93.**

This template works with MINIMAL client input + smart defaults.

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Client Input:** 5-10 fields

## 📋 DECISION TREE

   - YES → Use it, skip to technical setup
   - NO → Continue...

2. **"Do you have 2 hours + budget for a brand workshop?"**
   - YES → Use VERSION B (FULL)
   - NO → Continue...

3. **"Can you provide logo, colors, and fonts?"**

## 🎯 REALISTIC WORKFLOW

### **Client Kickoff Call (30 min):**

**You ask:**
1. "What's your domain?"
2. "When was company founded?"
3. "Who's your target audience?"
4. "What industry are you in?"
5. "Static site, web app, or mobile app?"
6. "Do you have logo files?"
7. "Do you have brand colors/fonts, or want me to choose?"

**Client answers those 7 questions = YOU'RE DONE.**

**You say:**
"Perfect! I'll set up a professional brand system based on industry best practices. You'll see it in the first mockup. If you want to customize colors/fonts, we can do that in revision."

---

### **Your Setup (15 min):**

1. Open `design-tokens-template.ts`
2. Copy industry default colors for their sector
3. Set font to Plus Jakarta Sans (safe default)
4. Create simple text logo if they don't have one
5. Use generic content templates
6. Apply content restrictions
7. **START BUILDING**

---

### **First Mockup:**

Client sees professional design with:
- Industry-appropriate colors
- Modern typography
- Clean, minimalist layout
- Professional content

**90% say:** "Looks great! Maybe change [1-2 small things]"  
**10% say:** "I want completely different colors/style" → Offer FULL brand workshop (additional fee)

## 💡 WHY THIS WORKS

### **Benefits:**

1. **Speed:** 45 min vs 3 hours
2. **Reduces client friction:** Don't need answers they don't have
3. **Professional defaults:** Based on industry standards
4. **Show, don't ask:** Easier for clients to react than create
5. **Upsell opportunity:** FULL workshop as premium add-on
6. **Protects you:** Content restrictions always applied
7. **Realistic:** Works with what 90% of clients actually provide

### **Client Psychology:**

**Bad:** "I need 93 decisions from you before I start"  
**Good:** "Give me your domain and industry, I'll handle the rest professionally"

**Bad:** "What colors do you want?"  
**Good:** "I used professional blue (trust) + green (growth) for tech companies. Want to see alternatives?"

Clients don't know what they want until they see it. **Show, then adjust.**
