# SECTION 14: QUESTIONS FOR US

Before I finalise the quotation and timeline, I just need a few quick clarifications to lock the scope:

1. Should the passenger website support complete booking, or only information/support pages?

2. For iOS apps, would you happen to have an Apple Developer Account, or should I help set one up?

3. Since Phase 1 will be cash-only, do you want online payments added in Phase 2?

4. For the emergency button, who should receive the alert — your team or selected contacts?

5. Would you like me to create the branding (logo/colours), or will you be able to provide references?

6. Do you have any estimate for peak concurrent users during busy hours?

After launch, would you prefer monthly maintenance or a pay-as-you-go support model?

[3:39 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 1. I need a passenger website that supports complete booking which will mostly target tourists who can book a cab before ariving at a airport.
[3:42 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 2. No I don't have a developer Account and I Need help to setup one and also I need to understand more about it
[3:46 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 3. Yes I want an option for online payment to be added in phase 2 but it will depend on feedback from the drivers if they are willing to accept it. Just for clarity will the payments go directly into driver account or how will it work.
[3:51 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 4.lets leave that emergency button to phase two. Because I need to do further research as to how it will be best to respond in a emergency situation.  I am thinking maybe it can be directed towards the police or relevant authority or emergency service providers.so for now let's leave it for phase 2.
[4:08 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 5. Yes please do the branding and logo. AI doesn't wonders with logo and branding nowadays. 2 colour's. Green, gold, black  or white of something more interesting can also be considered.
[4:16 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: 6. concurrent user at peak hours may range from 50 to 100 and is expected to change as people get used this as this will be something new here.
[4:19 am, 5/12/2025] +679 968 0798: After launch I would be okay with both but would prefer monthly maintenance. Or which one you think would be a better one?

Any questions you'd like to ask before we prepare the quotation?
