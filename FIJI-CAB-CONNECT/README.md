### 1. **Financial Administration (09-PAYMENTS/)**
Active folder for managing project finances, contracts, and payments.

### 2. **Future Phase Placeholders (05-08/)**
Empty folders reserved for future phase documentation. These represent planned organizational structure but are not yet active.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Empty Folders:** Folders 05-08 are intentionally empty - they're placeholders for future use
2. **Active Folder:** Only 09-PAYMENTS/ is actively used in Phase 1
3. **Alternative Locations:** Current equivalents exist in other folders:
   - Testing docs: `01-DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCE/13_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Deployment docs: `01-DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCE/12_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`
   - Mobile app code: `09-FRONTEND-MOBILE/`
4. **Financial Security:** Ensure 09-PAYMENTS/ contents are not exposed publicly

---

## 🔄 Relationship to Other Folders

**This folder is separate from:**
- **02-PROJECT-PLANNING/payments/** - Active payment tracking and receipts
- **09-FRONTEND-MOBILE/** - Active mobile app development code
- **01-DOCUMENTATION/** - Active technical documentation

**Why separate?** This structure was established to isolate:
1. Sensitive financial documents (09-PAYMENTS/)
2. Future phase materials (05-08/) from active development folders

---

## 📝 Maintenance

**When to add content:**
- **05-08:** When respective phases begin
- **09-PAYMENTS:** As financial documents are generated

**Archive consideration:**
- If folders 05-08 remain empty after Phase 2 planning, consider relocating to 07-ARCHIVED/
- Current recommendation: Keep structure for Phase 2
