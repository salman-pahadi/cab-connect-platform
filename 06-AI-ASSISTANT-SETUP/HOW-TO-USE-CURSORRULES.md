# 🎯 HOW TO USE .cursorrules

## What is .cursorrules?

The `.cursorrules` file contains instructions for Cursor AI that are automatically loaded in **EVERY conversation** within this project folder.

Think of it as giving Cursor AI a permanent "expert brain" that remembers:
- Your project context
- Your brand identity
- Your technical requirements
- Your team of 8 senior experts

---

## ✅ IT'S ALREADY WORKING!

The `.cursorrules` file is now in your project root:
```
04-MARKETING-WEBSITE/.cursorrules
```

Cursor AI will automatically use it when you:
1. Open this folder in Cursor
2. Start any chat (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
3. Use Composer (Cmd/Ctrl + I)

**No setup needed!** Just start asking questions!

---

## 🚀 HOW TO USE IT

### **STEP 1: Open Cursor**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the right folder
cd D:\Projects\10_Recycle\FCC\FIJI-CAB-CONNECT\04-MARKETING-WEBSITE
```

Open this folder in Cursor (or make sure you're working in this directory).

---

### **STEP 2: Start a Chat**

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + L` to open Chat with AI

```

---

### **STEP 4: Watch the Experts Respond!**

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Problem: AI doesn't seem to know the project context**

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the right folder: `04-MARKETING-WEBSITE`
2. Check .cursorrules file exists (it should be hidden but there)
3. Restart Cursor
4. Try asking: "What project am I working on?"

---

### **Problem: AI gives generic responses**

**Solution:**
1. Start chat with: "Hello team, I'm working on FIJI CAB CONNECT"
2. Reference the experts by name: "Robert, can you help me with..."
3. Be specific about what you need

---

### **Problem: Need to update the rules**

**Solution:**
Just edit the `.cursorrules` file directly and save. Cursor will reload it automatically.
