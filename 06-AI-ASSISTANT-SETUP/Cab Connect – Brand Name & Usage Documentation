# **Cab Connect – Brand Name & Usage Documentation**

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how the brand name must be used everywhere**, to ensure:

* legal compliance in Fiji
* consistent branding across all platforms
* zero confusion between company name, domain, and app name
* future scalability without rebranding

This document is **authoritative**.
If something is not defined here, it should **not be improvised**.

---

## 2. Legal & Regulatory Context (Fiji)

### Legal constraint

* The word **“Fiji” cannot be used as the first word** in a registered business name in Fiji.

### Legal company name

* **Registered company name:**
  **Cab Connect**

This name is used for:

* government registration
* contracts
* invoices
* banking
* compliance
* app store developer accounts (later)

**“Fiji Cab Connect” is NOT a legal company name.**

---

## 3. Brand Name Hierarchy (Very Important)

To avoid confusion, the brand is split into **three layers**:

### 3.1 Legal Name

Used only where legally required.

* **Cab Connect**

Usage:

* legal documents
* invoices
* contracts
* footer legal text
* app store developer account name

---

### 3.2 Brand / Product Name (Primary)

This is the **public-facing brand**.

* **Cab Connect**

Usage:

* app name (Android / iOS)
* website header
* admin panel
* splash screen
* presentations
* marketing materials
* support communication

This is the name users remember.

---

### 3.3 Domain & Regional Identifier

Used only for **technical and regional context**.

* **Domain:** `fijicabconnect.com`

Meaning:

* Cab Connect operating in Fiji

The domain **does not define the brand name**.
It only defines **geographic operation**.

---

## 4. Brand Name Usage Rules (STRICT)

### 4.1 Correct Usage (Allowed)

✅ Cab Connect
✅ CAB CONNECT (uppercase, limited use)
✅ Cab Connect App
✅ Cab Connect – Ride Booking

---

### 4.2 Incorrect Usage (NOT Allowed)

❌ Fiji Cab Connect (as brand name)
❌ FIJICAB
❌ FijiCabConnect (as logo text)
❌ CabConnect (no space)
❌ Cab-Connect

These create:

* legal confusion
* branding inconsistency
* future rework

---

## 5. Logo Guidelines (Phase 1)

### 5.1 Logo Type

* **Text-based logo only**

### 5.2 Logo Text

```
Cab Connect
```

### 5.3 Font & Style (Guidance)

* Clean, modern, sans-serif
* Medium to semi-bold weight
* No decorative fonts
* No icons in Phase 1

Reason:

* flexible
* professional
* easy to change later
* perfect for MVP

---

### 5.4 Logo Usage

* App header
* Website header
* Admin panel
* App splash screen (simple)

Do **not** add:

* country flags
* car icons
* location pins
* gradients (Phase 1)

---

## 6. Website Branding Rules

### Header (Top of Website)

```
Cab Connect
```

### Domain

```
https://fijicabconnect.com
```

### Footer (Legal / Context)

Recommended footer text:

> © Cab Connect. Operating in Fiji.

or

> Cab Connect is a ride-booking platform operating in Fiji.

Do **not** display “Fiji Cab Connect” as a brand/logo.

---

## 7. Mobile App Branding

### App Display Name (Play Store)

```
Cab Connect
```

### App Icon Text (if any)

* None (logo only)
* Or “Cab Connect” (text logo)

### Package Name (Technical)

Example:

```
com.cabconnect.app
```

or

```
com.cabconnect.fiji
```

User-facing name remains **Cab Connect**.

---

## 8. Admin Panel & Internal Tools

### Admin Panel Title

```
Cab Connect – Admin
```

### Internal References

* Cab Connect Admin
* Cab Connect System

Avoid:

* FijiCabConnect Admin
* FIJICAB Admin

---

## 9. Cloud, Accounts & Infrastructure Naming

### Gmail

* `fijicabconnect@gmail.com` (technical / admin email)

### AWS Account Name

* Cab Connect

### Google Cloud / Firebase

* Project name: Cab Connect

### Environment Naming

* cabconnect-prod
* cabconnect-staging

The **domain name may include Fiji**, but **project names should not**.

---

## 10. Marketing & Communication

### Correct phrasing

* Cab Connect – a cab booking platform in Fiji
* Cab Connect operates across Fiji
* Book your ride with Cab Connect

### Avoid

* Branding as “Fiji Cab Connect”
* Overusing “Fiji” in logos or titles

---

## 11. Future Expansion (Why This Matters)

This structure allows:

* expansion outside Fiji
* same brand across countries
* same apps and logo
* no legal renaming
* no app re-submission due to brand change

Example later:

* Cab Connect (Fiji)
* Cab Connect (Australia)
* Cab Connect (NZ)

Same brand. Different regions.

---

## 12. Final Brand Lock (Authoritative)

✔ **Brand Name:** Cab Connect
✔ **Legal Entity:** Cab Connect
✔ **Domain:** fijicabconnect.com
✔ **Logo:** Text-based “Cab Connect”
✔ **User-facing name everywhere:** Cab Connect
✔ **“Fiji” used only as regional context, never as brand**

---

## 13. Enforcement Rule

If there is ever a conflict between:

* domain name
* legal name
* marketing copy

**Brand name = Cab Connect always wins.**
