## âœ… CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

### **TypeScript (Robert's Standards):**

```typescript
// âœ… EXCELLENT: Proper types, clear interface (Mobile/Admin)
interface RideRequest {
  pickupLocation: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    address: string;
  };
  dropoffLocation: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    address: string;
  };
  passengerNotes?: string;
}

export async function createRide(request: RideRequest): Promise<Ride> {
  const response = await apiClient.post<Ride>('/rides', request);
  return response.data;
}

// âŒ BAD: Any types, unclear structure
export async function createRide(request: any): Promise<any> {
  return apiClient.post('/rides', request);
}
```

### **Python/FastAPI (Robert's Standards):**

```python
# âœ… EXCELLENT: Type hints, service layer, proper validation
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from app.schemas.ride import RideRequest, RideResponse
from app.services.ride_service import RideService
from app.api.deps import get_db, get_current_user
from app.models.user import User

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/rides", response_model=RideResponse)
async def create_ride(
    ride_request: RideRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
) -> RideResponse:
    """
    Create a new ride request.
    
    Args:
        ride_request: Ride details (pickup, dropoff, etc.)
        current_user: Authenticated passenger
        db: Database session
    
    Returns:
        Created ride with ID and status
    
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If validation fails
    """
    service = RideService(db)
    try:
        ride = service.create_ride(current_user.id, ride_request)
        return ride
    except ValueError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

# âŒ BAD: No types, business logic in endpoint
@router.post("/rides")
async def create_ride(data, user, db):
    ride = Ride(**data)
    db.add(ride)
    db.commit()
    return ride
```

### **Accessibility (Dr. Emily's Standards):**

```tsx
// âœ… EXCELLENT: Semantic HTML + ARIA + keyboard support + touch targets (Mobile)
<Pressable
  onPress={handlePress}
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Accept ride request"
  accessibilityRole="button"
  style={{
    minHeight: 44,
    minWidth: 44,
    padding: 12,
  }}
>
  <Text style={{ fontSize: 16 }}>Accept Ride</Text>
</Pressable>

<Image 
  source={{ uri: imageUrl }}
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Driver profile photo"
  style={{ width: 50, height: 50 }}
/>

<TextInput
  placeholder="Pickup location"
  accessible={true}
  accessibilityLabel="Enter pickup location"
  accessibilityHint="Type your starting address"
  style={{ minHeight: 44 }}
/>

// âŒ BAD: No accessibility props, small touch targets
<TouchableOpacity onPress={handlePress} style={{ padding: 4 }}>
  <Image source={{ uri: imageUrl }} />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### **Performance (Rachel's Standards):**

```python
# âœ… EXCELLENT: Database query optimization (Backend)
from sqlalchemy.orm import joinedload

def get_ride_with_details(db: Session, ride_id: int) -> Ride:
    """Get ride with eager loading to avoid N+1 queries"""
    return db.query(Ride).\
        options(
            joinedload(Ride.passenger),
            joinedload(Ride.driver),
            joinedload(Ride.locations)
        ).\
        filter(Ride.id == ride_id).\
        first()

# Use database indexes
class Ride(Base):
    __tablename__ = "rides"
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    passenger_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), index=True)
    driver_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), index=True)
    status = Column(String, index=True)  # Frequently queried
    created_at = Column(DateTime, index=True)  # For sorting

# âŒ BAD: No eager loading, missing indexes
def get_ride_with_details(db: Session, ride_id: int) -> Ride:
    ride = db.query(Ride).filter(Ride.id == ride_id).first()
    # N+1 queries when accessing ride.passenger and ride.driver
    return ride
```

```typescript
// âœ… EXCELLENT: Mobile app performance (React Native)
import React, { memo, useMemo } from 'react';

const RideCard = memo(({ ride }: { ride: Ride }) => {
  const formattedDate = useMemo(
    () => formatDate(ride.createdAt),
    [ride.createdAt]
  );
  
  return <View>{/* Render ride */}</View>;
});

// Use FlatList for long lists (virtualization)
<FlatList
  data={rides}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <RideCard ride={item} />}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
  removeClippedSubviews={true}
  maxToRenderPerBatch={10}
  windowSize={5}
/>

// âŒ BAD: No memoization, using map for long lists
const RideCard = ({ ride }: { ride: Ride }) => {
  const formattedDate = formatDate(ride.createdAt); // Recalculates every render
  return <View>{/* Render ride */}</View>;
};

{rides.map(ride => <RideCard ride={ride} />)} // No virtualization
```

### **SEO (James's Standards - Admin Dashboard/Marketing Only):**

```tsx
// âœ… EXCELLENT: Complete metadata for Next.js pages
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Cab Connect Admin | Manage Rides & Drivers',
  description: 'Admin dashboard for managing Cab Connect platform',
  robots: 'noindex, nofollow', // Private admin area
    images: ['https://fijicabconnect.com/og-image.jpg'],
  },
  alternates: {
    canonical: 'https://fijicabconnect.com',
  },
  robots: {
    index: true,
    follow: true,
    googleBot: {
      index: true,
      follow: true,
      'max-video-preview': -1,
      'max-image-preview': 'large',
      'max-snippet': -1,
    },
  },
}

// âŒ BAD: Minimal metadata
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Home',
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ EXPERT TIPS & BEST PRACTICES

### **Robert (Development):**
- Always use TypeScript strict mode (no 'any' types)
- Backend: Service layer pattern for business logic
- Mobile: Redux Toolkit for state, no React Context for app state
- Use @/ import alias, avoid relative imports
- Test on real devices, not just simulators
- Git commit after each working feature

### **Sarah (Design):**
- Mobile-first always - design for 375px first
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- White space is your friend
- 3-color maximum per section
- Visual hierarchy through size, not color
- Consistent spacing using design system

### **James (SEO):**
- Admin dashboard and marketing site need proper SEO
- Keywords in first 100 words
- H1 must match page title
- Internal linking is critical
- Update sitemap after content changes
- Local SEO for Fiji market (Nadi, Suva, Lautoka)

### **Dr. Emily (Accessibility):**
- Tab through entire site monthly
- Test with screen reader quarterly
- Color is not the only indicator
- Focus states must be visible

### **Michael (DevOps):**
- Never commit secrets/API keys
- Test builds locally before deploying
- Monitor uptime with UptimeRobot
- Setup error logging (Sentry)

### **Lisa (Business):**
- Every page needs clear CTA
- Measure what matters (conversions)
- A/B test headlines and CTAs
- Review analytics weekly

### **David (Copy):**
- Benefits, not features
- One idea per sentence
- Active voice preferred
- Read copy aloud before publishing
- Localize for Fiji market (culture-aware messaging)

### **Rachel (Performance):**
- Backend: Optimize database queries, use indexes
- Backend: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Mobile: Optimize images, lazy load components
- Mobile: Minimize bundle size, code splitting
- Admin: Use Next.js Image component
- Monitor API response times (<500ms target)

## ðŸ”’ SECURITY & PRIVACY (Alex's Standards)

**Backend Security:**
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation (Pydantic schemas)
- SQL injection prevention (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Environment variables for secrets (never commit .env)

**Mobile Security:**
- Secure token storage (SecureStore/Keychain)
- HTTPS only API calls
- Input sanitization before display
- Certificate pinning for production

**Data Privacy:**
- Minimal data collection (Phase 1)
- Location data only during active rides
- User consent for SMS OTP
- GDPR-aware data handling
