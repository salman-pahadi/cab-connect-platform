## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS

### **Templates are not one-size-fits-all**

Each template has:
- **Quick Version** - For simple tasks (30 seconds to customize)
- **Detailed Version** - For complex tasks (2 minutes to customize)
- **Copy-Paste Examples** - Already complete (just customize [BRACKETS])

**Use whichever fits your task!**

### **Copy-Paste Examples by Phase**

Find your current phase:
- Phase 1: Backend API Setup
- Phase 2: Mobile App Development
- Phase 3: Admin Dashboard
- Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- Phase 5: Deployment

Each phase has complete ready-to-use examples!

### **The 3-Step Daily Workflow**

1. **Morning:** Know what to build
2. **Work:** Build it with AI help
3. **Evening:** Verify & commit

This workflow ensures:
- ✅ No confusion (you always know what to do)
- ✅ High quality (templates enforce best practices)
- ✅ Progress tracked (PROGRESS-TRACKER.md updated)
- ✅ Clean commits (quality checks before commit)

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Print QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md**
Keep it on your desk. You'll reference it constantly.

### **Tip 2: Use Copy-Paste Examples First**
Don't use basic templates. Find your phase, copy the complete example.

### **Tip 3: Customize ONLY [BRACKETS]**
Never modify the template structure. Only change [BRACKETED] parts.

### **Tip 4: Use Shorthand**
Instead of copying the whole template, you can use:
```
"T1: Show next micro-task"
"T2: Implement booking feature"
"T3: Fix error in file.tsx"
```

AI will understand!

### **Tip 5: NEVER Skip Template 11**
End-of-session checklist is critical. It:
- Verifies code quality
- Updates progress tracking
- Creates clean commits
- Sets up next day
