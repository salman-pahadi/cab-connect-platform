## ⚡ POWER USER TIPS

### **Tip 1: End Every Session Properly**

**ALWAYS run Template 11 (End of Session Checklist) before closing your work session!**

This ensures:
- ✅ No broken code is committed
- ✅ Progress is tracked
- ✅ Next session starts smoothly
- ✅ Team stays informed

**Quick End-of-Session Commands (Copy & Paste):**
```powershell
# Backend checks
cd 08-BACKEND; python -m pytest tests/ -v; python -m ruff check .

# Mobile checks
cd 09-FRONTEND-MOBILE; npm run type-check; npm run lint; npm test

# Admin checks
cd 10-ADMIN-DASHBOARD; npm run type-check; npm run lint; npm test

# Git commit
git status; git add .; git commit -m "type(scope): description"; git push
```

---

### **Tip 2: Chain Multiple Templates**

```
[PASTE TEMPLATE 1 - Session Start]

Then:

[PASTE TEMPLATE 2 - Implement Feature]

Result: AI loads framework + implements feature in one go
```

### **Tip 3: Save Your Common Variations**

Create a personal notes file with your frequently used customized templates.

### **Tip 4: Use Template Shortcuts**

Create shorter versions for repetitive tasks:

```
=== QUICK START ===
@prefix.md @PROGRESS-TRACKER.md

Task: [TASK]
Expert: [EXPERT NAME if specific]

[Details]
```

### **Tip 5: Reference Multiple Docs**

```
References:
- prefix.md (framework)
- implementation-strategy.md (templates)
- technical-architecture.md (structure)
- 01-DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCE/07_API_CONTRACTS.md (API specs)
```
